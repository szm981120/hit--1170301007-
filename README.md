The recent changes, which include LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, are all about my course assignments in Open Source Software Development.

The CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT file is according to this template which is given by PurpleBooth, https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426#contributing.
